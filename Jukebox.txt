A jukebox is a coin-operated music-playing machine that lets people choose and play songs in public places like diners, cafés, bars, and arcades. Think of it 
as an early, physical version of a music playlist that people could control by inserting money. 🎶

What a Jukebox Is

A Jukebox typically contains a collection of songs—originally on vinyl records, later on CDs, and now sometimes digital files. When someone inserts a coin or 
token, they can select a song using buttons or a touchscreen, and the machine automatically plays it through built-in speakers.

How It Works (Simple Explanation)

You insert a coin (or use a card in modern versions)

You choose a song number or title

The machine retrieves the record or file

The song plays out loud for everyone to hear

Why It’s Called a “Jukebox”

The word “juke” comes from African-American slang meaning to dance or have fun, and “box” refers to the machine itself.
